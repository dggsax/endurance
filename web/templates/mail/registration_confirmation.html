<p>Hello {{ member.first_name }}</p>

<p>Thank you very much for signing up to submit content to STS.050's Endurance Project. We're really excited to hear
    your experiences, stories, and thoughts as the current state of affairs have impacted them. In this email, we have a
    few links that are going to be important for you to keep track of, so please be sure to not delete this email!</p>

<ul>
    <li><b><a href="{{ member.magic_link | safe }}">Login Link:</a></b> this link will let you log back into our website
        so
        that you can access your files and edit
        your information. This link will enable anyone with the link to access the content you submit to us and change
        the biographical information you submitted, so make sure to keep it safe. If the link is not working, please
        email us and we'll get you set up.</li>
    <li><b><a href="{{ member.dropbox_file_upload_url | safe }}">Dropbox File Request Link:</a></b> this link will take
        you to
        the file request on Dropbox that we created specially for you. Anything you upload here will automatically be
        available to us for the project. There should be no limitations with what you can upload to this, but if you
        face any issues, please feel free to reach out to us.</li>
    <li><b><a href="{{ member.dropbox_shared_folder_url | safe }}">Dropbox Folder Link: </a></b> this link will take you
        to the Dropbox folder with all of the submissions you've given to us for review. As of now, there is no
        functionality on your part to delete anything in this folder, so if you upload something and decide later you
        don't want us to have access, please let us know. You can also view the contents of this folder by logging in to
        your profile using your login link.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you end up losing track of this email, let us know, we can send you this information again. If you lose your login
    link or it doesn't work, just go to endurance.mit.edu/login and click "Resend Magic Link"</p>

<p>This project was built over the last weekend, so if you find any issues or there is anything wrong with this email,
    please reply and let us know.</p>

<p>Wishing the best for you and yours,</p>

<p>Daniel "Gonzo" Gonzalez on behalf of STS.050's Endurance Team</p>
